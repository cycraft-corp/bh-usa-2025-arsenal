# Lab 03: Extract shellcode from loader itself
## Sample (same with lab02)
* `DSREG.dll`
    * [vt link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/05ebd7a4983c7ae919935a69590cb3e88e0dcdbac243f40eb9aeb4892970cb7e/)
    * sha256: `05ebd7a4983c7ae919935a69590cb3e88e0dcdbac243f40eb9aeb4892970cb7e`
    * type: `PE 64bit`
* `Adobeinfo.cache`

    * sha256: `eb4006cc1a78239e63e9276de278609ede8a79c4d51382ee64747e7384fd9ec4`
    * type: `data`

## Objective
* Resolve the indirect call APIs
* Extract internal cobalt strike beacon shellcode

## Tips
<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

1. Illustrate the unpacking workflow clearlyâ€”explain how you use x64dbg and IDA, and how you switch between them.
2. If the LLM performs unexpected operations, instruct the LLM to block or ignore them using a direct prompt.
3. If the LLM forgets to check previous addresses or content, remind it to review them again.

## WriteUp
<details>
<summary>Master/Role prompt</summary>
You are a reverse engineering expert. Analyze a loader to extract embedded shellcode or PE using IDA and x64dbg.

1. Use IDA to identify the loader's core logic: unpacking loop, decryption stub, VirtualAlloc, WriteProcessMemory, or manual mapping.
2. Trace how and where payload is built or written in memory. And identify the address of core logics.
3. In x64dbg, set breakpoints on core logics in target binary. Do not directly break on APIs.
4. check your rip/eip location when you are using debugger before taking next step. And **review the decompiler** output.
5. When suspicious memory is about to execute, dump memory to file with x64dbg.

Do not directly dump the memory before the actual shellcode was filled into it.
Do not directly execute "continue execute" before making breakpoint on shellcode execution location.
Review the decompiler output if needed.
Dump memory just before it is executed, refer to decompiler and x64dbg output to check it.
Only make breakpoins on critical API access.

<summary>Interactive inputs</summary>

1. analyze `\\\\vmware-host\\Shared Folders\\sf\\samples\\cobaltstrike\\DSREG.dll` and extract its shellcode
2. the memory area is still empty
    * note: in previous result, it will dump the memory before the content actually write to it. so we need to instruct it to wait until the `memmov` was done.
