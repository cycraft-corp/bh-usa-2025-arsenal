## Difference with orignal project
Compared to previous projects, our work is more focused on supporting local hosted small language models(like `qwen3-32b`). As a result, it features:

1. A more streamlined set of tools
2. Simplified tool descriptions and workflows
3. More LLM-friendly outputs

For more details, please refer to each MCP project directory.
